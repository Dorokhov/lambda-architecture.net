<p>
This post gives an overview about an article which shows the usage of an "lambda architecture" for an IoT analytics platform.
It combines reactive frameworks to build this kind of architecture. As basis for the
<a href='https://github.com/ANierbeck/BusFloatingData'>showcase</a> free available bus data of the Los Angeles Metro are used.
</p>

<p>
The showcase, visualizes in realtime bus positions on a map, but also shows those position of vehicles in the past. To prove
how analytics can be used, clusters of bus positions can also be shown on the map. It shows the specialities of storing
and visualizing geografical data in an Apache Cassandra.
